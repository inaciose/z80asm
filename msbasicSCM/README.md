# Z80 MS Basic SCM app
by Steve Cousins
- https://smallcomputercentral.com/

Available inside the SCW (Small Computer Workshop)

The asm only compile inside the SCW. 

The original MS Basic, and the Searle Grant adaptation sourcdes, are also inside the SCW zip.

There is also a pre compiled binary converted to intel hexfile, that runs in RAM at 8000
- SCMon_BASIC_code8000_dataA000

The intel hexfile of this version is here for my own comodity (for copy paste in terminal).

The Searle Grant sources are also availabe at:

THIS DOES NOT COMPILE
